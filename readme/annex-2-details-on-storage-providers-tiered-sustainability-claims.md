# Annex 2: Details on Storage Providerâ€™s Tiered Sustainability Claims



The information below provides specific details on the three (3) tiers of SPs Sustainability Claims, reporting requirements, and auditing procedures.

1. **Bronze Tier**: SPs should report approximate location, water usage, and energy consumption data to the Filecoin Green Reporting Portal for auditing, calculate their emissions profile according to the market-based attributional carbon accounting approach, and should either:
   1. match their energy consumption profile to Energy Attribution Credits (EACs) _**on a annual basis**_, or
   2. Provide evidence of green electricity products from their energy supplier (e.g. Green Tariffs)&#x20;
   3. Reporting Methods: Approximate location, water usage, granular energy consumption, and renewable energy purchases can be reported by monthly water and electricity utility bills, and/or documentation of contract with local water utility/provider and renewable energy purchases.&#x20;
   4. Auditing Process: Third-party auditors should confirm approximate location, water usage, energy consumption data, and renewable energy purchases by cross referencing all available materials.
   5. Benefits: If criteria are met, this tier may qualify SPs in the future to receive incentives such as Filecoin Plus datacap allocations, Reputation Score boosts, or loans. Details of these incentives will be determined in the future. \

2. **Silver Tier:** SPs should report approximate location, water usage, granular energy consumption data, hardware set-up to the Filecoin Green Reporting Portal for auditing, calculate their emissions profile according to the market-based attributional carbon accounting approach, and should match their energy consumption profile to EACs or GCs _**on a quarterly basis**._&#x20;
   1. Embodied Emissions: Reporting of the hardware set-up will enable Filecoin Green to calculate the embodied emissions of the hardware, and SPs will need to match hardware embodied emissions to high-quality carbon credits (removals or offsets). See Annex 3: Treatment of Carbon Credits for more details on this reporting requirement.&#x20;
   2. Reporting Methods: Approximate location, water usage, and energy consumption can be reported by monthly water and electricity utility bills that document electricity consumption in megawatt-hours (MWh) or kilowatt-hours (kWh), documentation of green electricity products from an energy supplier (e.g. Green Tariffs), electricity meter data, details (with pictures/videos) of hardware set-up, and/or documentation of contract with local water utility/provider and renewable energy purchases.&#x20;
   3. Auditing Process: Third-party auditors should confirm approximate location, energy consumption data, hardware set-up, and renewable energy purchases by cross referencing all available materials and conducting one (1) yearly on-site evaluation.&#x20;
   4. Benefits: If criteria are met, this tier may qualify SPs in the future to receive incentives such as Filecoin Plus datacap allocations, Reputation Score boosts, or loans. Details of these incentives will be determined in the future.\

3. **Gold Tier:** **Gold Tier:** SPs should report approximate location, water usage, granular energy consumption data, hardware set-up to the Filecoin Green Reporting Portal for auditing, calculate their emissions profile according to the consequential carbon accounting approach, and every unit of electricity used (MWh) must be accounted for by one of the following: 10. Onsite renewable energy generation, in which meter data is provided showing that consumption is matched by onsite generation on a 1-to-1 basis. 11. For consumption not matched by renewable onsite generation, emissions due to grid draw must be matched to avoided emissions accounted for by GCs, with a temporal resolution of one hour, obtained either through: 3. Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for new generation 4. GCs sold on the open market.
   1. Embodied Emissions: Reporting of the hardware set-up will enable Filecoin Green to calculate the embodied emissions of the hardware, and SPs will need to match hardware embodied emissions to high-quality carbon credits (removals or offsets). See Annex 3: Treatment of Carbon Credits for more details on this reporting requirement.&#x20;
   2. Reporting Methods: Approximate location, water usage, and energy consumption can be reported by monthly water and electricity utility bills that document electricity consumption in megawatt-hours (MWh) or kilowatt-hours (kWh), documentation of green electricity products from an energy supplier (e.g. Green Tariffs), electricity meter data, details (with pictures/videos) of hardware set-up, and/or documentation of contract with local water utility/provider and renewable energy purchases.&#x20;
   3. Auditing Process: Third-party auditors should confirm approximate location, energy consumption data, hardware set-up, and renewable energy purchases by cross referencing all available materials and conducting quarterly on-site evaluations.&#x20;
   4. Benefits: If criteria are met, this tier may qualify SPs in the future to receive incentives such as Filecoin Plus datacap allocations, Reputation Score boosts, or loans. Details of these incentives will be determined in the future.
