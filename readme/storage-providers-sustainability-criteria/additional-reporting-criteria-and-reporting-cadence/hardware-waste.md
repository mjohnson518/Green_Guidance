# Hardware Waste

Similarly, a comprehensive Filecoin Storage Provider Sustainability Claim should also include information on the utilization and disposal of hardware devices from operations. Storage Providers should report the configurations, utilization rates & time periods, and disposal & treatment of the hardware configurations and waste generated from their operations during each reporting period.

This includes the embodied emissions hardware devices during its useful life and from disposal of both solid solid (hardware) waste and wastewater. Storage Providers are also expected to calculate and report the estimated emissions from End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products, which requires assumptions about the end-of-life treatment methods used by any downstream actors, if applicable.

The physical hardware that is required to undertake Sealing and Storage have a carbon footprint from the materials, manufacturing, and disposal of the equipment during its life cycle â€“ known as embodied carbon. To derive the embodied carbon emissions from the hardware that is used for Sealing and Storage, SPs should report data for the Product Carbon Footprint of their hardware devices.

If Product Carbon Footprint data is not available, SPs should assume the lifecycle emissions of an AMD Ryzen 3970x 32 core (CPU) and Nvidia RTX 3090 TI (GPU). The Filecoin Green team is working on compiling Product Carbon Footprint data SPs hardware configurations and will provide more guidance on these figures in the near future..

For proper disposal and treatment of hardware, the [GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard Category 5](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Scope3\_Calculation\_Guidance\_0.pdf) covers the appropriate waste treatment activities, and [Category 12](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Scope3\_Calculation\_Guidance\_0.pdf) provides guidance on how to report a description of the methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the estimated emissions that downstream actors may generate during the End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products.
