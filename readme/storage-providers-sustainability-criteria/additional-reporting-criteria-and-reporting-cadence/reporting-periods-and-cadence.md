# Reporting Periods and Cadence

Filecoin Storage Providers that would like to differentiate themselves on environmental grounds should seek to report their GHG Emissions profile, Energy Consumption figures, and Renewable Energy Procurement details on a regular basis.

As specified in [**Annex 2: Details on Storage Providerâ€™s Tiered Sustainability Claims**](../../additional-resources/annex-2-details-on-storage-providers-tiered-sustainability-claims.md), the Filecoin Green Team recommends reporting once a quarter, at a bare minimum. Storage Providers who meet specific reporting requirements will be eligible to receive additional Filecoin Plus datacap allocations and Reputation Score boosts.
