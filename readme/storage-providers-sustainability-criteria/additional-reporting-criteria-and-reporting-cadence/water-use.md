# Water Use

Filecoin Storage Providers should also report on the water usage of their operations. The appropriate way to report water usage is similar to that of electricity consumption for GHG Accounting purposes. The activity data and information that SPs should submit includes:&#x20;

* Relevant minerIDs
* Monthly water bills, or documentation of contract with local water utility/provider
* Documentation of any equipment purchases related to water usage, if applicable
* Photo or video of setup, or video tour with auditor
* An agreement that output data can be made public, or note opting out of some datasets

Submitted information will be used for verifying SPsâ€™ water usage. If, for whatever reason, water usage data is not available, SPs should use the best possible estimation and, ideally, should publish their estimation methodology (e.g., include transparent documentation of the assumptions and rationale behind any estimations).&#x20;
