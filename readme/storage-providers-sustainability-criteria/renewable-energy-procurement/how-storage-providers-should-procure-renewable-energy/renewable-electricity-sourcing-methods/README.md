# Renewable Electricity Sourcing Methods

**Self-generation used for self-consumption:**

1. Self-generation from renewable facilities owned by the company (on or offsite):
   1. Self-generated renewable energy is the most “additional” method SPs can employ to procure their renewable energy needs. Building renewable energy assets to satisfy one’s own electrical needs adds renewable energy capacity to the local grid.&#x20;
   2. While self-generation may require a large upfront investment, it can be economically attractive, especially in areas where net metering is permitted and excess energy can be sold back to the grid.&#x20;
   3. When self-generation is practiced, the consumer takes responsibility for the financing of the project, and any associated risks.&#x20;
   4. In areas where other procurement methods are not available, owned generation may be the best option. Solar photovoltaics (PV) is a popular technology for on-site renewable generation.
