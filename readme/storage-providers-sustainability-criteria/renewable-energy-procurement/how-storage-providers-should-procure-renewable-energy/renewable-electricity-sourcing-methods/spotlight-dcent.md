# Spotlight: DCENT

[DCENT](https://dcent.nl/) is a large Filecoin Storage Provider located in the Netherlands that recently built a PV solar array on its operations. By creating a public API for data extraction, as well as an example ROI (return on investment) spreadsheet, they are helping to facilitate this kind of additional, owned renewable generation for similar actors. Furthermore, by having both their entire hardware installation and software implementation audited, they are setting an example for other Storage Providers on how to transparently decarbonize their operations.
