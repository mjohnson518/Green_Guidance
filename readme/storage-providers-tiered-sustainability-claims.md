# Storage Provider’s Tiered Sustainability Claims

In order to comply with the FGP, Storage Providers can make Sustainability claims in three (3) ways, each of which requires SPs to report audited approximate location, energy consumption, and renewable production data on a regular basis. The three types of Sustainability Claims follow a tiered hierarchy according to how granular the information is. The more rigorous the reporting and auditing procedures, the greater the Filecoin Plus datacap allocations and Reputation Score boosts the Storage Provider stands to receive. It is worth noting that these requirements are subject to change, and increase over time. The three tiers of Sustainability Claims follow the hierarchy listed below:

1. **Bronze Tier**: SPs should report approximate location, water usage, and energy consumption data to the [Filecoin Green Reporting Portal](annex-3-filecoin-green-reporting-portal.md) for auditing, calculate their emissions profile according to the market-based attributional carbon accounting approach, and should ethier:
   1. match their energy consumption profile to Energy Attribution Credits (EACs) _**on a annual basis**_, or;
   2. Provide evidence of green electricity products from their energy supplier (e.g. Green Tariffs).
2. **Silver Tier:** SPs should report approximate location, water usage, granular energy consumption data, hardware set-up to the [Filecoin Green Reporting Portal](annex-3-filecoin-green-reporting-portal.md) for auditing, calculate their emissions profile according to the market-based attributional carbon accounting approach, and should match their energy consumption profile to EACs or GCs _**on a quarterly basis**_.
   1. Embodied Emissions: Match hardware embodied emissions to high-quality carbon credits (removals or offsets).
3. **Gold Tier:** SPs should report approximate location, water usage, granular energy consumption data, hardware set-up to the [Filecoin Green Reporting Portal](annex-3-filecoin-green-reporting-portal.md) for auditing, calculate their emissions profile according to the consequential carbon accounting approach, and every unit of electricity used (MWh) must be accounted for by one of the following:\

   1. Onsite renewable energy generation, in which meter data is provided showing that consumption is matched by onsite generation on a 1-to-1 basis.
   2. For consumption not matched by renewable onsite generation, emissions due to grid draw must be matched to avoided emissions accounted for by GCs, with a temporal resolution of one hour, obtained either through:
      1. Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for new generation
      2. GCs sold on the open market
   3. Embodied Emissions: Match hardware embodied emissions to high-quality carbon credits (removals or offsets).

Additional details on these three Tiers are provided in [**Annex 2: Details on Storage Provider’s Tiered Sustainability Claims**](annex-2-details-on-storage-providers-tiered-sustainability-claims.md). The information that follows is meant to inform Filecoin Storage Providers how to account for and report GHG emissions and electricity consumption, and how to make decisions about the procurement of renewable energy.
