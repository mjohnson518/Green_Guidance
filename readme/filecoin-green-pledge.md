# Filecoin Green Pledge

Moving forward past 2022, to encourage collective decarbonization efforts across the Filecoin network, the Filecoin Green Team has created the Filecoin Green Pledge (FGP), a first of its kind pledge that Filecoin Storage Providers may make to showcase their commitment to sustainability across their global operations. Adhering to the FGP means that Storage Providers are committed to:&#x20;

* 80% renewable electricity procurement by EOFY 2023
* 100% renewable electricity procurement by EOFY 2025
* Maintaining 100% renewable electricity procurement on a continuous basis from thereon

These percentage thresholds, defined as the portion of renewable electricity over total electricity use, must be _publicly verifiable_, meaning that they must be able to _demonstrate a cryptographic proof of an exclusive claim to use of unique renewable electricity generation_ to meet the threshold percentages of their reported electricity usage, and must apply across all their global operations.

We have set these stringent thresholds because, due to the evolving regulatory landscape, we are confident that recording and reporting on the proportion of renewable energy used against the overall energy consumption will become a mandatory monitoring and reporting requirement for many jurisdictions in the near future. If all Storage Providers adhere to the FGP, the Filecoin Green team is confident that the entire Filecoin network will be **100% carbon neutral by EOFY 2025.**

This timeline is in-line with many legacy industry actors, such as [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/aws-launches-customer-carbon-footprint-tool/), and quicker than other web3 initiatives, such as the [Crypto Climate Accord](https://cryptoclimate.org/accord/).

To incentivize Storage Providers to meet these threshold requirements, the Filecoin Green team has determined tiers of compliance, which, if met, may qualify SPs in the future to receive incentives such as Filecoin Plus datacap allocations, Reputation Score boosts, or loans. Details of these incentives will be determined in the future.

The Filecoin Reputation Score is meant to quantify, through a single number, the reliability of a Storage Provider for storage and retrieval deals so that clients can make informed decisions when selecting a miner. If sustainability criteria are added to the Reputation Score matrix, Filecoin Green will incentivize Storage Providers to decarbonize their operations by procuring more renewable energy. The information below explains the procedures and criteria weâ€™ve set for SPs to showcase adherence to, and compliance for, the FGP and publicly verifiable sustainability claims.
