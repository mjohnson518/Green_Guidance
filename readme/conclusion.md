# Conclusion

**The clock is ticking, and there is no time to wait**. The World must take _decisive and collective action_ to decarbonize all forms of economic activity within this decade, or else face an increasingly unstable climate.

At Protocol Labs, our mission is to drive breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward. With Filecoin Green, we are leveraging the unique incentives of crypto-economic systems to drive collective action toward reducing emissions, showcasing industry-wide decarbonization, and creating new demand for clean technologies.

We’re building the web3-native monitoring and reporting tools to measure the environmental impacts of Filecoin and verifiably drive them below zero. We’re doing this by connecting the entire network to renewable energy, allowing each individual Filecoin Storage Provider to publicly prove their source of electricity.

In doing so, we’re also building infrastructure that can be leveraged by actors in other web3 ecosystems or legacy industries to make transparent and substantive environmental claims for their own operations.

The criteria and procedures provided in this document give Storage Providers clear and actionable guidance on how to conduct a comprehensive carbon accounting exercise, how to source renewable electricity, and how to report compliance to the Filecoin Green Pledge.

By adhering to the guidance herein, Storage Providers can provably showcase how they are accounting for and reducing the environmental impacts of their operations, laying out a pathway to sustainability for the Filecoin network.
