# ðŸ‘¾ CO2.Storage

The Filecoin Green team is developing CO2.Storage to provide a web3 storage solution for environmental assets based on content addressed data schemas. This project is the continuation of the idea posted in the Filecoin Green Tools repo: [0006-FGTP-CO2\_Storage](https://github.com/protocol/FilecoinGreen-tools/blob/main/0006-FGTP-CO2\_Storage.md).\

This project should be considered _**pre-alpha**_ and is not yet ready for production use. The Filecoin Green team is actively working on this project and welcomes contributions from the community.
