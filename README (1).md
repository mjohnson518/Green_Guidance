# Storage Providers Green Guidance Documentation

## Motivation:

Filecoin Storage Providers (SPs) would benefit from guidance around how to approach sustainable operations. A guidance document should lay out best practices from carbon accounting, renewable energy procurement, and related industries in order to suggest how to approach sustainable operations. This content is based on the [Filecoin Green Tools Issue #5](https://github.com/protocol/FilecoinGreen-tools/blob/main/0005-FGTP-Green-SP-Guidance.md).
