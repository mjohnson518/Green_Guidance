## API Examples

For CLI examples showing how to add data, authenticate data, and manage accounts using the Javascript API, see the [repo here](https://github.com/protocol/co2-storage/tree/main/cli/src/examples). For information on how to get them working, jump to the previous section: [Setting Up the CLI](setting-up-the-cli.md).

## Examples

To publicly discuss and crowd-source data schemas for CO2.Storage, and to encourage standardization and reduce fragmentation of data schemas across the Refi space, the Filecoin Green team has created the [CO2.Storage Schemas Repo](https://github.com/protocol/co2\_storage\_schemas). In this repository, there are several example schemas based on projects from notable carbon credit registries. These include:

* [Verra](https://github.com/protocol/co2\_storage\_schemas/blob/main/Schemas/examples/verra.json)
* [Gold Standard](https://github.com/protocol/co2\_storage\_schemas/blob/main/Schemas/examples/gold-standard.json)
* [ACR](https://github.com/protocol/co2\_storage\_schemas/blob/main/Schemas/examples/acr.json)
* [Toucan](https://github.com/protocol/co2\_storage\_schemas/blob/main/Schemas/examples/toucan.json)

An example of what these schemas looks like on the CO2.Storage UI is included below:

## Gas Emissions Measurements

One of the datasets on co2.storage is a set of measurements of methane (CH4, a powerful greenhouse gas) made available by our friends at [Hyphen](https://twitter.com/HYPHEN\_AG). This data is taken from atmospheric observation sites throughout the world, giving information about where methane is being emitted.

To access the data using the co2.storage UI follow these steps:

1\) Go to [co2.storage](https://co2.storage/) and click on "Assets" in the upper right hand corner.

2\) If you get a login error, connect your Metamask wallet to co2.storage to log in.

3\) In the upper left hand corner, choose "Gas Emissions Measurements - Hyphen" to display the CH4 datasets.&#x20;

4\) Click on an asset (example: CH4 2023-3-6) to load and browse asset data.
