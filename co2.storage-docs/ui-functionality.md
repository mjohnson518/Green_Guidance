## UI Functionality

The UI enables users to quickly create and prototype new environmental asset templates (or schemas), as well as clone existing templates. After defining or choosing a template (schema), users can then create individual assets based on these schemas.&#x20;

The initial process flow generally follows a similar route:

* User defines or selects a schema from available templates.
* User inputs all relevant data and uploads any accompanying documentation (such as pdfs/images of Offset/REC/Audit certifications or attestations.
* User selects if they want an independent third-party audit conducted to verify data matches the data inputs and accompanying documentation.
* User confirms submission of template to Co2.Storage, and in return is given a CID for that template.
* User then utilizes the submitted template to create individual assets based on the defined template.
* User confirms submission of the asset to Co2.Storage, and in return is given a CID for that asset.
* User utilizes the schema and asset CIDâ€™s in the URI of their environmental claim, NFT, or [Hypercert](http://hypercerts.xyz).
