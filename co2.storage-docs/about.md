## About

[CO2.Storage](https://co2.storage) is a decentralized storage solution for structured data based on content addressed data schemas. CO2.Storage primarily focuses on structured data for environmental assets, such as Renewable Energy Credits, Carbon Offsets, and geospatial datasets.  This focus stems from our realization that the budding Refi space, and tokenized carbon credits in particular, would benefit from the development of standard data schemas for environmental assets.

This project should be considered pre-alpha and is not yet ready for production use. The [Filecoin Green](https://green.filecoin.io/) team is actively working on this project and welcomes contributions from the community.

We are seeking input to encourage standardization and reduce fragmentation of data schemas across the Refi space. To publicly discuss and crowd-source data schemas for CO2.Storage, please visit: [CO2.Storage Schemas Repo](https://github.com/protocol/co2\_storage\_schemas).

We are also actively seeking input on features from industry participants and interested parties. Please provide your contact information if you'd like to receive updates: [CO2.Storage Updates Form](https://forms.gle/CS5tY4kpsajpiTGV7).

Data made available through CO2.storage is provided by users, and not verified by Filecoin Green.
