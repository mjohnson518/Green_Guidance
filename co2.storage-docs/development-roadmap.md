# ðŸ—º Development Roadmap

## Development Roadmap and other resources (link to repo, issues, etc.)

The Filecoin Green team and community contributors are actively working on several new features for CO2.Storage, including:

* Go API
* Go Indexer
* Support for geospatial data
* Project class that will sit above schema & asset creation - this should enable more of a full end-to-end project development workflow
* Functionality to assist in collecting public datasets via [Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/).

The repo is hosted on Github here: [https://github.com/protocol/co2-storage](https://github.com/protocol/co2-storage)

Active Issues are listed here: [https://github.com/protocol/co2-storage/issues](https://github.com/protocol/co2-storage/issues)
