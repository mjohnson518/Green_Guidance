# ðŸ“— Filecoin Green Documentation

[Filecoin Green](https://green.filecoin.io/) is our effort to make rich environmental accounting a Web3 Superpower.\
\
We're doing this by building the tools to measure the environmental impacts of Filecoin and verifiably drive them below zero, building infrastructure along the way that can be leveraged by anyone to make transparent and substantive environmental claims for their own operations.

This is the official Documentation hub for Filecoin Green, and it is intended to provide a detailed overview of the web3-native monitoring and reporting tools we are developing for publicly verifiable sustainability claims.
